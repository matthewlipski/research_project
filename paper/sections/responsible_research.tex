\section{Responsible Research}\label{sec:responsible-research}
All code used for this research is open source can be found at https://github.com/matthewlipski/research\_project.
Due to the inherent randomness present when training neural networks, the results presented in this paper may not be completely reproducible.
However, using the same code and hardware, it should be possible for anyone to reach the same conclusions based on their own findings.
